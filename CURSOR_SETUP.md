# Using JoJoPlayground with Cursor

This project is built for Claude Code, but works with Cursor too. The project files, architecture, and conventions are identical — only the AI rules setup differs.

---

## Setup

1. Open the project folder in **Cursor**
2. The Cursor rules are already configured at `.cursor/rules/jojoplayground.mdc` — no extra setup needed
3. To connect Figma: go to **Cursor Settings > Tools & MCP**, find the Figma entry, and toggle it **on** (green = connected). If there's no Figma MCP set up yet, search YouTube for "how to set up Figma MCP in Cursor" and follow the guide
4. If MCP issues occur: toggle it **off**, wait a few seconds, toggle **back on**. Make sure the **Figma desktop app** is open (not the browser version)

Everything else — SPEC.md, FLOW_TEMPLATE.md, README.md — works the same regardless of which AI tool you use.
