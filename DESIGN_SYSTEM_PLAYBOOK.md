# How to Build Your Design System in JoJoPlayground

> A step-by-step record of building a design system from scratch using the JoJoPlayground starter kit. Follow along to build your own.

## How This Playbook Works

This playbook documents every phase of building a design system — from adding fonts to shipping flows. Each phase is updated with the exact steps taken as the work is completed, so it doubles as a reusable guide for other designers.

**Status markers:**
- **Not started** — Phase hasn't been touched yet
- **In progress** — Currently working on this phase
- **Done** — Completed with full step-by-step instructions

**Project files you'll touch:**

| Phase | Key Files |
|-------|-----------|
| Fonts | `Fonts/`, `Info.plist` |
| Colors | `DesignSystem/Tokens/DSColors.swift` |
| Typography | `DesignSystem/Tokens/DSTypography.swift` |
| Spacing | `DesignSystem/Tokens/DSSpacing.swift` |
| Icons & Images | `Assets.xcassets/` |
| Components | `DesignSystem/Components/` |
| Flows | `Features/` |

All paths are relative to `JoJoPlayground/`.

## Phase 1: Fonts

Add your custom font files so the design system can reference them.

> **Status: Not started**

*Steps will be documented here as this phase is completed.*

---

## Phase 2: Colors

Define your color palette as tokens in `DSColors.swift`.

> **Status: Not started**

*Steps will be documented here as this phase is completed.*

---

## Phase 3: Typography

Define type styles in `DSTypography.swift` using the fonts from Phase 1.

> **Status: Not started**

*Steps will be documented here as this phase is completed.*

---

## Phase 4: Spacing

Define your spacing scale in `DSSpacing.swift`.

> **Status: Not started**

*Steps will be documented here as this phase is completed.*

---

## Phase 5: Icons & Images

Export assets from Figma and add them to the asset catalog.

> **Status: Not started**

*Steps will be documented here as this phase is completed.*

---

## Phase 6: Components

Build reusable `DS`-prefixed components from your design system.

> **Status: Not started**

*Steps will be documented here as this phase is completed.*

---

## Phase 7: Flows

Assemble components into full user flows. See [FLOW_TEMPLATE.md](FLOW_TEMPLATE.md) for the code template.

> **Status: Not started**

*Steps will be documented here as this phase is completed.*

## Final Step

Once all phases are done, update the token tables in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) (Section 5) so the AI knows your complete design system.
